                <h3>3.Halloween (Various countries): </h3>
                <p>    Halloween's origins date back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked
                    the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. The Celts believed that on the night of
                    October 31st, the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred, allowing spirits to roam the
                    earth. To ward off these spirits, the Celts lit bonfires and wore costumes.<br><br> With the spread of
                    Christianity, Samhain was integrated into Christian traditions as All Hallows' Eve, later shortened to
                    Halloween, the night before All Saints' Day. Over time, Halloween evolved with influences from European
                    traditions like "souling" and the customs of Irish and Scottish immigrants in North America.<br><br>
                    Today,
                    Halloween is celebrated in many countries around the world, blending ancient customs with modern
                    festivities like costumes, trick-or-treating, and pumpkin carving.

                    ancient origins. It is a time when Koreans express gratitude to their ancestors for the year's harvest
