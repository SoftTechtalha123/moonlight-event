                <h3>3.Vesak (Date varies) </h3>
                <p>      Vesak, also known as Buddha Day, is a major Buddhist festival that commemorates the birth,
                    enlightenment, and death of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. The festival is celebrated on the
                    full moon day in the month of Vesakha (usually in May, but the date varies depending on the lunar
                    calendar) and is observed by Buddhists around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    The origins of Vesak can be traced back to ancient India, where it was celebrated as a harvest festival.
                    According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born, attained enlightenment, and passed away on the
                    same dayâ€” the full moon day of Vesakha.
                    <br><br>
                    The festival is celebrated with various activities, including visiting temples, offering alms to monks,
                    chanting of Buddhist scriptures, and lighting lanterns. Buddhists also perform acts of generosity, such
                    as giving food and clothing to the needy, as a way of honoring the Buddha's teachings on compassion and
                    kindness.
                    <br><br>
                    Vesak is not only a time of celebration but also a time for Buddhists to reflect on the teachings of the
                    Buddha and to strive for personal spiritual development. It is a day of joy and gratitude for the wisdom
                    and compassion that the Buddha is believed to have brought to the world.

                <h3>4.Gawai Dayak (May 31) : </h3>
                <p>      Gawai Dayak is a festival celebrated in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo,
                    primarily by the Dayak people, who are the indigenous people of Sarawak. The festival is a time of
                    thanksgiving and marks the end of the rice harvesting season.
                    <br><br>
                    The origins of Gawai Dayak can be traced back to the early 1960s when a group of Dayak intellectuals led
                    by Michael Buma developed the idea of a festival to celebrate the Dayak culture and way of life. They
                    wanted to create an event that would bring the Dayak people together to celebrate their cultural
                    identity and traditions.
                    <br><br>
                    The first Gawai Dayak festival was held on June 1, 1964, and since then, it has become an annual event
                    celebrated on May 31st and June 1st. The festival typically begins with a ceremony called the "Miring"
                    ceremony, where offerings are made to the gods and spirits to ensure a successful harvest and to thank
                    them for their blessings.
                    <br><br>
                    During Gawai Dayak, traditional rituals and ceremonies are performed, including the "Ngabang" or
                    visiting ceremony, where families and friends visit each other to strengthen bonds and share food and
                    drink. There are also cultural performances, such as traditional music and dance, as well as games and
                    competitions.
                    <br><br>
                    Gawai Dayak is an important cultural event for the Dayak people, as it allows them to showcase their
                    traditions and customs to the wider community. It is also a time for the Dayak people to come together
                    to celebrate their unity and to honor their ancestors and the land that sustains them.</p>

                <h3>5. Flores de Mayo (May) </h3>
                <p>      Flores de Mayo, also known as "Flowers of May," is a festival celebrated in the Philippines in honor of
                    the Virgin Mary. The festival has its roots in the Catholic traditions brought by Spanish colonizers to
                    the Philippines in the 16th century.
                    <br><br>
                    The festival is typically held during the entire month of May, which is considered the "Month of Mary"
                    in Catholic tradition. It is a time when Filipinos pay homage to the Virgin Mary through prayers,
                    processions, and offerings of flowers. The festival also often includes the recitation of the rosary, a
                    series of prayers dedicated to Mary.
                    <Br><br>
                    One of the highlights of Flores de Mayo is the Santacruzan, a religious-historical pageant that reenacts
                    the finding of the True Cross by Queen Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine. The Santacruzan
                    features a procession of young women and men dressed in elaborate costumes, representing biblical
                    characters and historical figures associated with the Christian faith.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years, Flores de Mayo has become a popular cultural and religious festival in the Philippines,
                    celebrated not only in churches but also in schools, communities, and even in Filipino communities
                    abroad. It is a colorful and festive event that reflects the strong devotion of the Filipino people to
                    the Virgin Mary and their rich cultural heritage. </p>
